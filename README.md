# odin-recipes
This is my third attempt at the odin project. 
Honestly I'm getting tired of all these restarts.
Last time for the recipes project I did Yamarita, Garri and some other Nigerian food that I don't remember.
I did those cause the recipes were easy to type out. This time around I actually want to take my time and put effort into the projects, not just trying to speed run them.


This time I'm showcasing the:
1. Nigerian Jollof Rice
2. Nigerian Buns and
3. Mei Shayi Noodles - something I find myself making alot this Ramadan.
